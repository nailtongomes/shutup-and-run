# Decisions

Short records of choices that are easy to second-guess later. Each one is context, the decision, and what it costs.

## Push, no queue

Orchestrators already know the list of machines. shutup-and-run accepts a job or refuses. It does not queue, retry across hosts, or elect a leader. A full machine is `429`. A draining machine is `503`. The caller moves on.

## Slots come from Docker labels

A slot is a running container labeled `shutup-and-run=1`. The count is a Docker list, not a counter in memory, so a restart does not forget work that is still running. The check and the create share one process mutex. Two processes on the same daemon can still go over `max_slots`.

## SQLite for history, logs, and bans

One file. Job rows keep id, image, `job_key`, start, end, exit code, and reason, so `GET /v1/jobs/{id}` works after a restart. The last log lines are stored before the container is removed. Bans live in the same file. Finished rows older than `history_days` (default 30) are deleted on a timer. There is no other database.

## Idempotency is `job_key`, on one machine

The same key returns the existing row and does not start another container, including while it is running. A retry of the same URL is safe. The key is not shared with other machines. A start that fails still holds the key; a new attempt needs a new key.

## Callback when the job ends

An optional `callback_url` receives status, exit code, duration, and reason. Three tries, no redirects, and it does not hold a slot. The container still writes its own result wherever it already does. The callback is only a nudge to Kestra or n8n.

## Drain

`POST /v1/drain` with `{"draining": true}` refuses new work with `503` and lets running jobs finish. The flag is in SQLite, so a restart stays drained.

## Every route requires the bearer token

Including `/health` and `/metrics`. A missing or wrong token is `401`. Nothing on the port is anonymous.

## Three failures, then 48 hours

Three `401`s from the same TCP peer ban that IP for 48 hours. Both numbers are config. The ban is `403` with an empty body, even if the next request has the right token, and it survives a restart. A later success clears the failure count. The peer is the socket address. `X-Forwarded-For` counts only when `trust_x_forwarded_for` is set. `shutup-and-run bans` and `shutup-and-run bans lift <ip>` fix a lock-out over SSH.

## Public IP and TLS in the binary

One owner, one host, a public address. The token must not cross the internet in clear text, so the binary serves HTTPS with rustls. The installer makes a self-signed certificate and prints its SHA-256 fingerprint. Clients pin it or skip verification on purpose. Plain HTTP is an explicit `http = true`, for localhost or a network that is already private.

## One owner

There is no user database and no per-tenant token. One token is the whole ACL.

## Timeouts are SIGKILL

A container past its deadline is killed with SIGKILL. There is no SIGTERM grace and no restart of a container that exits on its own.

## No volumes, published ports, or privileged

The request can set image, env, command, timeout, cpu, memory, and shm. It cannot mount the host, publish a port, or run privileged. The image's own entrypoint is what runs.

## MIT

The license is MIT. It is short, it is what operators expect to copy onto a server, and it does not need a NOTICE file. SQLite, which is bundled, is public domain.

## The name

The owner named it `shutup-and-run`. It is the whole product: send a job, get a container, or get a refusal. Earlier nautical names (`berth`, `kedge`, `cleat`, and others) were already used by other Docker tools.
